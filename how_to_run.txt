Warning: 
We also made use of a LRN2D layer which was removed from the keras source. It needs to be manually included as mentioned below:

*Paste the contents of keras_addition.txt in /usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/keras/layers/normalization.py.
*Add from .normalization import LRN2D right under the import from .normalization import BatchNormalization in 
	  /usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/keras/layers/__init__.py . The file path may vary depending on your python version.
